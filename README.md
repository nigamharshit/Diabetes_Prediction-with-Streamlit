# Diabetes_Prediction-with-Streamlit

Diabetes prediction with stream lit WebappHere, I created a diabetes prediction model, which predicts whetherthe person is Diabetic or not. Independent variables are – Pregnancy, Glucose,Blood pressure, Skin Thickness, insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function andAge and the Dependent variable is – Outcome. If the outcome is 1 it means theperson is Diabetic and if outcome is 0 then it means the person is non-Diabetic.  In the Data preprocessing stage, I performedfeature scaling. I used a Support Vector Classifier to train our model.  Through this, I achieved an accuracy of 80 %in test data. 

<br>Then I used the Pickle library whichis used for implementing binary protocols for Serializing and Deserializing apython object. So, I had used the module pickle.dump() to convert theclassifier trained into a file – ‘trained_model.sav’   (SAV stands for - Saved Backup OrConfiguration Data), which I will use in Spyder IDE through pickle.load() tode-serialize it and use this classifier there and then I deployed it in Streamlitwebapp. Streamlit is an open-source app framework in Python language. It helpsus create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time.
